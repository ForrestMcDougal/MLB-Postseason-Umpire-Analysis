* Team Members
 * Brian Pate, Dan Boulden, Forrest McDougal, Brandon Alexander, Ethan John
* Project Description/Outline
 * We would like to examine the consistency of a Major League Baseball Umpire. Primarily we would like to see if an umpire’s strike zone adjusts over the course of a post-season and whether their strike zone varies depending on whether the batter is left or right-handed. We will accomplish this using an an API from sportsradar which provides the majority of the data. The data we will use will come from 33 post-season game in 2018.
* Research Questions to Answer
 * 1. Do umpires have a consistent strike zone over the course of a post-season?
 * 2. Does an umpire’s strike zone vary depending if the batter is right of left handed?
 * 3. Does an umpire’s strike zone vary depending if the pitcher is right or left handed?
 * 4. Does an umpire’s strike zone vary based on the pitch type?
* Data Sets to be Used
 * SportsRadar API
 * Standardized strikezone dimensions to overlay on charts
* Rough Breakdown of Tasks
 * 1. Retrieving data using API- 2 person
 * 2. Cleaning data, putting into dataframe
 * 3. Plotting using matplotlib
 * 4. Summarizing and presentation – consult plotting
